    <h2>Reasons for joining Altschool</h2>
    <p>I joined Altschool because of 
        the tremendous curiosity and 
        interest I have for Software engineering.
        I truly enjoy coding, and think it is fun,
        and a very good skill to acquire because it 
        is a Job in demand in the market now.
        I would like to build my own frontend Software,
        and one of the ways to allow me to achieve is through
        joining Alt school. From an early age, I found solace in 
        the meticulous world of accounting. <br>The allure of balance sheets 
        and income statements fascinated me, as I discovered the stories
        that financial data could tell about the health and vitality of a
        business.<br> The art of decoding financial narratives became my forte, 
        and I soon realized that accounting was not merely about numbers on 
        a page but a dynamic language that spoke volumes about the heartbeat 
        of an organization.
